                  <br><h2>What is Git?</h2>
                  <br><p>Git is a free, open-source version control software. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. This tool is a version control system that was initially developed to work with several developers on the Linux kernel.</h3>
                  <br><p>This basically means that Git is a content tracker. So Git can be used to store content — and it is mostly used to store code because of the other features it provides.</h3>
                  <br><p>Real life projects generally have multiple developers working in parallel. So they need a version control system like Git to make sure that there are no code conflicts between them.</h3>
                  <br><p>Also, the requirements in such projects change often. So a version control system allows developers to revert and go back to an older version of their code.</h3>
                  <br><p>The branch system in Git allows developers to work individually on a task (For example: One branch -> One task OR One branch -> One developer). Basically think of Git as a small software application that controls your code base, if you’re a developer.</h3>

                  <br><h2>Git Repositories</h2>
                  <br><p> we want to start using Git, we need to know where to host our repositories.</h4>
                  <br><p>A repository (or “Repo” for short) is a project that contains multiple files. In our case a repository will contain code-based files.</h3>
                  <br><p>There are two ways you can host your repositories. One is online (on the cloud) and the second is offline (self-installed on your server).</h3>
                  <br><p>There are three popular Git hosting services: GitHub (owned by Microsoft), GitLab (owned by GitLab) and BitBucket. We’ll use GitHub as our hosting service.</h3>
